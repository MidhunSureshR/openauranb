<h1>How do I use this?</h1>

1)Download the openauranb file from the cmake-build-debug folder 
2)Run it with:
	sudo ./openauranb color_code
<i>Argument color_code must be in hex format without the '#'.
For eg, If you wanted to make your backlight red (#FF0000), you would run:
	sudo ./openauranb FF0000
You can use any color-picker to find hex code of your desired color.
